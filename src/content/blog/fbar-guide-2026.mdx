You moved to the US a few years ago. You filed your taxes with a CPA or maybe even TurboTax. You thought you were done.

Then someone on Reddit mentions "FBAR" and your stomach drops.

If you have bank accounts, fixed deposits, mutual funds, PPF, or even a life insurance policy in India, there is a very real chance you are required to file an FBAR every single year -- and the penalties for not doing so start at **$10,000 per account, per year** you missed.

This is the guide we wish someone had handed us. No jargon. No hedging. Just exactly what you need to know about FBAR filing as an NRI in the United States in 2026.

## What Is FBAR?

FBAR stands for **Foreign Bank Account Report**. Its official name is **FinCEN Form 114**, and it is filed with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which is part of the U.S. Department of the Treasury.

Here is the short version: if you are a U.S. person (citizen, green card holder, or resident alien who meets the substantial presence test) and you have financial accounts outside the United States that collectively exceeded **$10,000 at any point during the calendar year**, you must report every single one of those accounts on an FBAR.

Notice the word "collectively." You do not need $10,000 in any one account. If the combined maximum balances across all your foreign accounts crossed $10,000 on even one day in 2025, you are on the hook.

### Why does FBAR exist?

FBAR was originally created under the **Bank Secrecy Act of 1970** to help the U.S. government detect money laundering, tax evasion, and other financial crimes. It predates most modern tax compliance requirements by decades.

It is not part of the Internal Revenue Code. It is not filed with the IRS. It goes to FinCEN. This matters because the penalty structure is separate from the IRS, and FBAR non-compliance is treated as a **standalone violation** -- even if you owed zero U.S. tax on the money in those accounts.

> **Key point:** FBAR is not about owing taxes. It is about disclosure. Even if every rupee in your Indian accounts is fully tax-exempt under the DTAA, you still must file FBAR if you meet the threshold.

### Who counts as a "U.S. person"?

For FBAR purposes, a U.S. person includes:

- U.S. citizens (including dual citizens)
- U.S. lawful permanent residents (green card holders)
- Resident aliens who pass the Substantial Presence Test (most H-1B, L-1, and other work visa holders who have been in the US for 183+ days)

If you are on an F-1 or J-1 visa and are still in your exempt period, you are typically not considered a U.S. person for FBAR purposes. But once you transition to H-1B or pass the substantial presence test, you are.

## Do You Need to File FBAR as an NRI?

Let us cut to the chase. If any of the following apply to you, you almost certainly need to file:

- You have an **NRO savings account** in India (even with just a few lakhs)
- You have an **NRE savings account** or NRE fixed deposits
- You have **Indian mutual funds** (equity, debt, ELSS -- any of them)
- You have a **PPF account** (yes, even if you cannot contribute to it as an NRI)
- You have an **EPF balance** from a previous employer in India
- You have a **life insurance policy with cash surrender value** (LIC, HDFC Life, etc.)
- You have **Indian stocks** in a demat account
- You have an **Indian post office savings** or recurring deposit
- You are a **signatory or have joint ownership** on a parent's or spouse's account in India

### The $10,000 threshold -- it is lower than you think

The threshold is **$10,000 in aggregate peak balance** across all foreign accounts. You calculate this by looking at the maximum balance each account held at any point during the year, converting each to USD at the Treasury's year-end exchange rate, and then adding them all up.

Let us do the math. At an exchange rate of roughly 85 INR to 1 USD:

- $10,000 = approximately 8.5 lakh rupees

If you have an NRO account with 3 lakh, an NRE FD with 4 lakh, and a mutual fund folio worth 2 lakh, your aggregate is 9 lakh -- you are over the threshold.

Most NRIs who have lived in India for any reasonable period before moving to the US will cross this threshold without even trying.

### Which accounts count?

This is where many NRIs get tripped up. FBAR covers **all** foreign financial accounts, not just bank accounts. Here is a comprehensive list for India:

**Definitely reportable:**
- NRO savings and current accounts
- NRE savings and current accounts
- NRO and NRE fixed deposits (FDs)
- Indian mutual fund folios (each folio is a separate account)
- Indian stocks and demat accounts
- PPF (Public Provident Fund) accounts
- NPS (National Pension System) accounts
- EPF (Employee Provident Fund) balances
- Post office savings accounts and NSCs
- Bank locker contents (if the locker has financial instruments)

**Often missed but still reportable:**
- Life insurance policies with cash surrender value (LIC endowment, ULIPs, HDFC Life, SBI Life, etc.)
- Joint accounts where you have signatory authority (even if you are not the primary holder)
- Accounts held by an entity you control more than 50% of

**Typically NOT reportable:**
- Real estate / immovable property (reported elsewhere, not on FBAR)
- Gold jewelry or physical gold
- Term life insurance (pure protection, no cash value)

> **Warning:** A common mistake is thinking "my parents' account, I am just a joint holder" does not count. It absolutely does. If you have signatory authority or financial interest in any foreign account, it must go on your FBAR.

## FBAR Deadlines 2026

For the 2025 tax year (the FBAR you are filing in 2026):

| Milestone | Date |
|-----------|------|
| Tax year covered | January 1 - December 31, 2025 |
| Original FBAR deadline | **April 15, 2026** |
| Automatic extension | **October 15, 2026** |
| Extension request needed? | **No** -- extension is automatic |

Unlike a tax return extension, the FBAR extension to October 15 is **automatic**. You do not need to file for it. If you miss April 15, you have until October 15 without any penalty.

That said, do not use October as your plan. Life gets busy. Tax season energy fades. Set a reminder for early April and file alongside your tax return.

[See all NRI deadlines](/calendar) to make sure FBAR is not the only thing on your radar.

### Can you file FBAR before April 15?

Yes. The BSA E-Filing system opens for the new tax year in early January. There is no reason to wait if you have your account statements ready.

## What Happens If You Don't File

This is the part that keeps people up at night -- and for good reason. FBAR penalties are among the harshest in U.S. compliance law, and they apply **per account, per year**.

### Non-willful violations

If you genuinely did not know about FBAR (and can demonstrate that), the IRS can still impose a penalty of up to **$10,000 per violation**. A "violation" is one unreported account for one year.

Let us say you have 5 Indian accounts and missed FBAR for 3 years. That is 15 violations. At $10,000 each, you are looking at up to **$150,000** in potential penalties -- for non-willful non-compliance.

The IRS has some discretion here and may assess lower amounts, but the statutory maximum is $10,000 per violation. This amount is adjusted annually for inflation; for 2026, the inflation-adjusted non-willful penalty cap is approximately **$16,117 per violation**.

### Willful violations

If the government determines you knew about the requirement and chose not to file (or deliberately concealed accounts), the penalties escalate dramatically:

- **Civil penalty**: The greater of **$100,000** or **50% of the account balance** at the time of the violation, per account, per year
- **Criminal penalty**: Up to **$250,000 in fines** and/or **up to 5 years in prison**

"Willful" does not necessarily mean you signed a document saying "I refuse to file." Courts have found willfulness where taxpayers checked "No" on Schedule B (the question about foreign accounts) or where they had constructive knowledge of the requirement.

### The 6-year statute of limitations

The government has **6 years** from the date an FBAR was due to assess penalties. So if you missed filing for 2019, FinCEN has until April 15, 2026 to come after you for that year.

This means that right now, the IRS can potentially assess penalties for any unfiled FBARs from **2020 through 2025**.

> **This is not hypothetical.** The IRS has aggressively pursued FBAR penalties in recent years. Cases like *Bittner v. United States* (2023) went all the way to the Supreme Court. In that case, the Court ruled that non-willful penalties apply per form (not per account), which was actually a favorable ruling for taxpayers. But willful penalties still apply per account.

### FBAR penalties summary

| Type | Maximum Penalty | Per What? |
|------|----------------|-----------|
| Non-willful | ~$16,117 (inflation-adjusted) | Per form, per year |
| Willful (civil) | Greater of $100,000 or 50% of balance | Per account, per year |
| Willful (criminal) | $250,000 fine + 5 years prison | Per violation |

## How to File FBAR

The good news: filing FBAR is free, and the process is entirely online. The bad news: you need to gather information from every reportable account, which can be tedious if you have many Indian accounts.

### Step 1: Gather your account information

For every foreign financial account you held during 2025, you need:

- **Name of the financial institution** (e.g., HDFC Bank, SBI, ICICI Prudential MF)
- **Account number** (bank account number, mutual fund folio number, demat account number, etc.)
- **Type of account** (bank, securities, mutual fund, insurance, pension, etc.)
- **Maximum value of the account during 2025** in the account's currency (INR for most Indian accounts)
- **Address of the financial institution**
- Whether the account was opened or closed during the year

For the maximum value, you need the **highest balance at any point during the year**, not the year-end balance. For bank accounts, check your monthly statements. For mutual funds, check your portfolio value on the date it was highest.

### Step 2: Convert to USD

Convert each account's maximum balance to USD using the **Treasury Reporting Rate of Exchange** for December 31, 2025. This rate is published by the U.S. Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service.

Do not use Google exchange rates or your bank's rate. Use the official Treasury rate.

### Step 3: Go to the BSA E-Filing System

FBAR is filed electronically through FinCEN's BSA E-Filing System:

1. Go to [https://bsaefiling.fincen.treas.gov](https://bsaefiling.fincen.treas.gov)
2. You can file without creating an account (select "File FBAR" under the individual filer section)
3. Alternatively, create an account if you want to save progress and file for multiple years

### Step 4: Fill out the form

The form has several sections:

- **Filer Information**: Your name, SSN/ITIN, date of birth, address
- **Account Information**: For each account -- institution name, account number, type, country, maximum value
- **Joint owners**: If any account is jointly held, enter the other owner's details

You will need to enter each account separately. If you have 8 accounts, you will fill out 8 account sections.

### Step 5: Sign and submit

Review everything, electronically sign, and submit. You will receive a confirmation page with a BSA ID. **Save this confirmation.** Print it or save the PDF. This is your proof of filing.

### Step 6: Keep records for 5 years

You are required to keep records of your FBAR filing and the account information that supports it for **5 years from the due date of the FBAR**. This means maintaining copies of your Indian bank statements, mutual fund account statements, and insurance policy documents.

> **Pro tip:** Create a dedicated folder (digital or physical) for each tax year. Drop in all your Indian account statements and your FBAR confirmation. Future you will thank present you.

## Common Mistakes NRIs Make

After working with hundreds of NRIs on compliance issues, we see the same mistakes over and over.

### 1. Forgetting joint accounts

Your NRO account that your mother is a joint holder on? Both of you may have FBAR obligations (she does not if she is not a U.S. person, but you do). Your spouse's NRE account that you are a joint holder on? That goes on YOUR FBAR too.

### 2. Not counting PPF

Many NRIs think PPF does not count because they cannot contribute to it after becoming an NRI. Wrong. If the account exists and has a balance, it is reportable. The same goes for EPF balances you left behind from a previous employer.

### 3. Not counting insurance policies

LIC endowment plans, ULIPs, and other policies with a cash surrender value are financial accounts for FBAR purposes. If your parents bought you a policy years ago and it has maturity value, you need to report it.

### 4. Using the wrong exchange rate

You must use the **Treasury year-end exchange rate**, not Google, not XE, not your bank's rate. For 2025, this rate will be published in early January 2026.

### 5. Reporting year-end balance instead of maximum balance

FBAR asks for the **maximum value** during the year, not the value on December 31. If your mutual fund portfolio peaked at 25 lakh in September but was 18 lakh at year-end, you report 25 lakh.

### 6. Confusing FBAR with FATCA

FBAR (FinCEN 114) and FATCA (Form 8938) are two entirely different filings with different thresholds, different forms, different destinations, and different penalties. You may need to file both. We break down the differences below.

### 7. Thinking "small amounts don't matter"

There is no de minimis exception. If you have a dormant NRO account with Rs. 500 and it pushes your aggregate over $10,000, that account must be reported.

### 8. Filing FBAR with the IRS

FBAR does not go to the IRS. It goes to FinCEN through the BSA E-Filing system. Your CPA should know this, but double-check. Some taxpayers have "filed" FBAR by mailing it with their tax return, which means it was never actually filed.

## FBAR vs FATCA

This is one of the most confusing areas for NRIs. Both require you to report foreign accounts, but they are separate obligations with different rules.

| Feature | FBAR (FinCEN 114) | FATCA (Form 8938) |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Full name** | Foreign Bank Account Report | Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets |
| **Authority** | FinCEN (Treasury) | IRS |
| **Filed with** | FinCEN BSA E-Filing (online only) | Attached to your tax return (Form 1040) |
| **Threshold (unmarried, US resident)** | $10,000 aggregate at any time | $50,000 on last day OR $75,000 at any time during year |
| **Threshold (married filing jointly, US resident)** | $10,000 aggregate at any time | $100,000 on last day OR $150,000 at any time |
| **Threshold (living abroad)** | $10,000 aggregate at any time | $200,000 on last day OR $300,000 at any time |
| **What is reported** | All foreign financial accounts | Foreign financial accounts + assets (stocks held directly, partnership interests, etc.) |
| **Due date** | April 15 (auto-extension to Oct 15) | With your tax return (April 15 or Oct 15 with extension) |
| **Non-willful penalty** | Up to ~$16,117 per form | $10,000 per failure to file |
| **Willful penalty** | Up to $100K or 50% of balance | $50,000 for continued failure after IRS notification |
| **Criminal penalties** | Yes (up to $250K + 5 years) | Yes |

**The bottom line:** if you meet the FBAR threshold, you likely also meet or are close to the FATCA threshold. Many NRIs need to file both. They are not interchangeable -- you cannot file one and skip the other.

## Streamlined Filing Procedures

If you are reading this and realizing you should have been filing FBAR for the past several years, do not panic. The IRS offers a path to get compliant without facing the full force of penalties.

### Streamlined Domestic Offshore Procedures (SDOP)

If you have been **living in the US** and failed to file:

- File the last **3 years of tax returns** (amended if needed)
- File the last **6 years of FBARs**
- Pay a **5% miscellaneous offshore penalty** on the highest aggregate balance of foreign accounts during the 6-year FBAR period
- Submit a certification statement explaining that your failure was non-willful

The 5% penalty is significantly less than what you would face if the IRS caught you first.

### Streamlined Foreign Offshore Procedures (SFOP)

If you have been **living outside the US** for at least 330 days in any of the last 3 years:

- Same filing requirements as SDOP
- **No miscellaneous offshore penalty** (0%)
- Submit a certification of non-willful conduct

### Delinquent FBAR Submission Procedures

If you have been filing your tax returns correctly and only missed the FBAR:

- File all delinquent FBARs electronically
- Include a statement explaining why the filings are late
- **No penalty** is typically assessed if the IRS has not already contacted you about it and you have reported all income from the foreign accounts on your tax returns

> **Critical warning:** These streamlined procedures are only available if the IRS has not already begun an examination or investigation. If you have received a letter from the IRS about foreign accounts, these programs may no longer be available to you. Consult a tax attorney immediately.

### Should you use streamlined procedures?

If you have unfiled FBARs from past years, the answer is almost certainly yes -- but with professional help. The certification statement requires you to describe in detail why your failure was non-willful, and getting this wrong can have serious consequences.

We strongly recommend working with a CPA or tax attorney who specializes in international tax for streamlined filings.

## FBAR and Indian Account Types: A Quick Reference

Since NRIs hold a wide variety of accounts in India, here is a quick reference for how common Indian financial instruments are treated on FBAR:

| Indian Account Type | Reportable on FBAR? | Notes |
|--------------------|--------------------|-------|
| NRO Savings | Yes | Report max balance during year |
| NRE Savings | Yes | Even though earnings are tax-exempt in India |
| NRO/NRE Fixed Deposits | Yes | Each FD may be a separate account |
| Mutual Funds (all types) | Yes | Each folio is a separate account; also triggers PFIC |
| PPF | Yes | Even if you cannot contribute as NRI |
| EPF | Yes | Even if dormant from prior employment |
| NPS | Yes | Report accumulated corpus |
| Demat Account (stocks) | Yes | Report market value of holdings |
| LIC (endowment/ULIP) | Yes | Report cash surrender value |
| Term Insurance | No | No cash surrender value |
| Real Estate | No | Not a financial account (report on Form 8938 if applicable) |
| Physical Gold/Jewelry | No | Not a financial account |
| Post Office Savings/NSC | Yes | Often forgotten |
| Sukanya Samriddhi | Yes | If held for daughter, and you are U.S. person |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to file FBAR if I am on an H-1B visa?

In most cases, yes. If you have been in the US long enough to pass the Substantial Presence Test (generally 183 days in the current year, or a weighted formula over 3 years), you are considered a U.S. resident for tax purposes and must file FBAR if you meet the $10,000 threshold.

### My Indian accounts are all in my parents' names. Do I still need to file?

If you have no signatory authority and no financial interest in those accounts, no. But if you are a joint holder, have a power of attorney, or the accounts are held for your benefit, the answer is yes.

### I already paid tax in India on interest earned. Do I still need to file FBAR?

Yes. FBAR is a reporting requirement, not a tax payment. Whether you owe US tax on the income is a separate question (you may get a credit for taxes paid in India under the DTAA). But the FBAR filing obligation exists regardless.

### What if my accounts never crossed $10,000 in aggregate?

Then you do not need to file FBAR for that year. But be honest with yourself about the aggregate calculation. Did you check the peak balance for each account, or just the year-end balance? Did you count all accounts including PPF, EPF, and insurance policies?

### Can my CPA file FBAR for me?

Yes. A CPA, tax attorney, or enrolled agent can file on your behalf using FinCEN's third-party filing option. They will need a signed authorization (FinCEN 114a) from you.

### Is there an FBAR filing fee?

No. FBAR filing is completely free. Do not pay anyone who says there is a government fee for filing FBAR (though professionals may charge for the service of preparing and filing it on your behalf).

## Key Takeaways

Here is everything distilled into what you need to remember:

- **FBAR is mandatory** for any U.S. person (citizen, green card holder, or tax resident) with $10,000+ in aggregate foreign account balances at any point during the year
- **The threshold is low.** Most NRIs with any meaningful financial footprint in India will cross $10,000 (approximately Rs. 8.5 lakh)
- **Almost everything counts** -- NRO, NRE, FDs, mutual funds, PPF, EPF, NPS, demat accounts, and insurance policies with cash value
- **The 2026 FBAR deadline** for tax year 2025 is April 15, 2026 with an automatic extension to October 15, 2026
- **Non-willful penalties** can reach ~$16,117 per form per year; **willful penalties** can be the greater of $100,000 or 50% of account balance per account
- **FBAR is separate from FATCA.** You may need to file both. They go to different agencies and have different thresholds
- **Filing is free and online** through the BSA E-Filing system at FinCEN
- **If you have missed past years**, the Streamlined Filing Procedures offer a way to get compliant with reduced or zero penalties -- but act before the IRS contacts you
- **Keep records for 5 years** -- Indian bank statements, MF statements, insurance documents, and FBAR confirmations
- **Joint accounts count.** If you have signatory authority on any foreign account, it goes on your FBAR
