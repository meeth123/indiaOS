## Why NRIs Need a Compliance Calendar

You have deadlines in two countries. Not one. Two.

The IRS wants things on its schedule. The Indian Income Tax Department wants things on its schedule. And those schedules do not align. They do not coordinate. They do not care that you are one person with one brain trying to keep track of both.

Miss an FBAR? That is $10,000 per account per year -- and that is the *non-willful* penalty. Miss your Indian ITR filing? Late fees, plus your refunds get held up. Let your PAN become inoperative because you did not link Aadhaar? Suddenly every payment from India gets hit with 20% TDS instead of the standard rate.

These are not hypothetical scenarios. These are things that happen to NRIs every single year because nobody gave them a single, clear list of what is due and when.

This article is that list.

We have compiled every compliance deadline that matters for NRIs in the US during 2026. Month by month. With the actual penalty amounts. Bookmark this page. Set your reminders. And if you want to know which of these deadlines specifically apply to your situation, [take the 2-minute compliance quiz](/quiz).

## The Two-Country Deadline Problem

As an NRI in the US, you are subject to obligations from **both** the IRS and Indian tax authorities simultaneously. The US taxes worldwide income. India taxes income originating in India. Both countries have separate reporting requirements for foreign assets.

That means in any given month, you might owe a US quarterly estimated tax payment **and** an Indian advance tax installment, a US information return (FBAR, FATCA) **and** an Indian income tax return, or a US state filing **and** an Indian regulatory update (PAN-Aadhaar linking, bank KYC).

The overlap is relentless. Here is the full calendar.

---

## January 2026

| Deadline | Filing | Authority | Who Needs This |
|----------|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Jan 15 | Q4 Estimated Tax Payment (2025) | IRS | NRIs with US income not subject to withholding |
| Jan 31 | TDS Return Q3 (Oct-Dec 2025) | India IT Dept | NRIs who deduct TDS on Indian payments (e.g., rent) |

### Q4 Estimated Tax -- January 15

If you have income without taxes withheld at source -- freelancing, rental income, capital gains, investment income -- you owe quarterly estimated taxes to the IRS. The Q4 payment for tax year 2025 is due January 15, 2026. Miss this and you face an underpayment penalty plus interest at the federal short-term rate plus 3 percentage points.

### TDS Return Q3 India -- January 31

If you own property in India and receive rental income through a tenant who deducts TDS, the Q3 TDS return (covering October through December 2025) is due by January 31.

---

## March 2026

| Deadline | Filing | Authority | Who Needs This |
|----------|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Mar 15 | Advance Tax Q4 (FY 2025-26) | India IT Dept | NRIs with Indian tax liability over Rs 10,000 |
| Mar 31 | Revised/Updated ITR (AY 2024-25) | India IT Dept | NRIs who need to correct previously filed returns |

### Advance Tax Q4 India -- March 15

India's advance tax system requires quarterly installments. By March 15, you should have paid 100% of your estimated Indian tax liability for FY 2025-26. This is the final true-up payment after your June, September, and December installments.

Applies if your total Indian tax liability exceeds Rs 10,000 -- rental income, capital gains from selling Indian property or mutual funds, or interest income above the TDS threshold.

### Revised ITR -- March 31

If you filed your Indian income tax return for AY 2024-25 (the return that was originally due July 31, 2025) and made errors, March 31, 2026 is your last chance to file a revised return under Section 139(5). After this date, you lose the ability to correct mistakes for that assessment year.

---

## April 2026 -- The Big Month

This is the month that breaks people. April is when the US federal filing obligations converge, and if you are an NRI with assets in India, you are likely dealing with multiple forms due on the same day.

| Deadline | Filing | Authority | Penalty for Missing |
|----------|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| Apr 15 | Form 1040 (Federal Income Tax) | IRS | 5% of unpaid tax per month, up to 25% |
| Apr 15 | FBAR (FinCEN 114) | FinCEN | $10,000+ per violation (non-willful); $100,000+ (willful) |
| Apr 15 | FATCA Form 8938 | IRS | $10,000 + $10,000 per 30 days, up to $60,000 |
| Apr 15 | PFIC Form 8621 | IRS | Punitive excess distribution tax regime |
| Apr 15 | Q1 Estimated Tax (2026) | IRS | Underpayment penalty + interest |
| Apr 15 | Form 4868 (Extension Request) | IRS | Extends filing to Oct 15 (not payment) |
| Apr 15 | State Tax Returns | State | Varies by state |

Let's break each one down.

### Form 1040 -- April 15

Your federal income tax return covering worldwide income: US salary, Indian rental income, Indian mutual fund capital gains, Indian bank interest, dividends -- everything. Claim the Foreign Tax Credit (Form 1116) or Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (Form 2555) to avoid double taxation.

**Penalty**: 5% of unpaid tax per month, up to 25%. Failure-to-pay adds 0.5% per month on top. These stack.

**Extension**: File Form 4868 by April 15 for an automatic extension to October 15. This extends the *filing* deadline only -- you still owe estimated tax by April 15.

### FBAR (FinCEN Form 114) -- April 15

If the aggregate balance of all your foreign financial accounts exceeded $10,000 at any point during 2025, you must file an FBAR. This is not a tax form -- it is a Bank Secrecy Act report filed directly with FinCEN.

What counts as a foreign financial account? Indian bank accounts (savings, NRE, NRO, FDs), mutual fund accounts, PPF, insurance policies with cash value (LIC), brokerage/demat accounts, and any account you have signature authority over.

**Penalty**: $10,000 per violation for non-willful. $100,000 or 50% of account balance (whichever is greater) for willful. Per account. Per year. This is the single most dangerous filing for NRIs.

**Extension**: Automatic extension to October 15 -- no form needed. But do not let that lull you into forgetting. Read our [detailed FBAR guide](/blog/fbar-guide-2026).

### FATCA Form 8938 -- April 15

If your foreign financial assets exceed certain thresholds, you must file Form 8938 with your tax return. Thresholds for US-based filers:

- **Single**: $50,000 on the last day of the year, or $75,000 at any point
- **Married filing jointly**: $100,000 on the last day, or $150,000 at any point

Yes, this overlaps with FBAR. Different thresholds, different filing methods, different penalties. You may report the same accounts on both.

**Penalty**: $10,000 for failure to file, plus $10,000 per 30 days after IRS notification, up to $60,000.

### PFIC Form 8621 -- April 15

If you hold Indian mutual funds, you almost certainly have PFICs (Passive Foreign Investment Companies). The IRS treats non-US mutual funds as PFICs, and the tax treatment is punitive by design.

You must file Form 8621 for each PFIC you own. If you hold 5 different Indian mutual fund schemes, that is 5 separate Form 8621 filings.

**Penalty**: If you do not file Form 8621, the IRS applies the "excess distribution" regime by default, which results in significantly higher taxes and interest charges on any gains. Learn more about your [NRI tax obligations](/blog/nri-tax-obligations).

### Q1 Estimated Tax 2026 -- April 15

Your first quarterly estimated tax payment for tax year 2026 is also due April 15. This is separate from the balance due on your 2025 return.

### State Tax Returns -- April 15

Most states follow the federal deadline. If you live in California, New York, New Jersey, Texas (no state income tax), or any other state, check your state's specific requirements. Some states have unique rules for foreign income reporting.

## May 2026

| Deadline | Filing | Authority | Who Needs This |
|----------|--------|-----------|----------------|
| May 31 | TDS Return Q4 (Jan-Mar 2026) | India IT Dept | NRIs who deduct TDS on Indian payments |

### TDS Return Q4 India -- May 31

The Q4 TDS return covering January through March 2026 is due by May 31. If you have tenants in India paying rent on your property, or you make any payments subject to TDS, this applies to you.

---

## June 2026

| Deadline | Filing | Authority | Who Needs This |
|----------|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Jun 15 | Q2 Estimated Tax (2026) | IRS | NRIs with US income not subject to withholding |
| Jun 15 | Advance Tax Q1 (FY 2026-27) | India IT Dept | NRIs with Indian tax liability over Rs 10,000 |
| Jun 30 | PAN-Aadhaar Linking | India IT Dept | All PAN holders (including NRIs) |
| Jun 30 | Property Tax | Local Municipal Authority | NRIs who own property in India |

### Q2 Estimated Tax -- June 15

Second quarterly estimated tax payment to the IRS for 2026. By now, you should have paid at least 50% of your estimated annual US tax liability.

### Advance Tax Q1 India -- June 15

First installment of advance tax for FY 2026-27. Pay at least 15% of your estimated Indian tax liability by this date.

### PAN-Aadhaar Linking -- June 30

This is the one that catches NRIs off guard. If your PAN is not linked to your Aadhaar by June 30, 2026, your PAN becomes **inoperative**. That means:

- TDS on all payments to you jumps to 20% instead of the applicable rate
- You cannot file your Indian income tax return
- You cannot process certain financial transactions in India

Linking Aadhaar from outside India involves additional steps. Do not wait until June. Read our [PAN card guide for NRIs](/blog/pan-card-inoperative-nri) for step-by-step instructions.

### Property Tax India -- June 30

If you own property in India, municipal property tax is typically due by June 30 (varies by city). Penalties for late payment range from 1-2% per month.

---

## July 2026

| Deadline | Filing | Authority | Who Needs This |
|----------|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Jul 31 | Indian ITR-1 / ITR-2 (AY 2026-27) | India IT Dept | Most NRIs with Indian income |
| Jul 31 | Form 67 (Foreign Tax Credit) | India IT Dept | NRIs claiming FTC in India |
| Jul 31 | TDS Return Q1 (Apr-Jun 2026) | India IT Dept | NRIs who deduct TDS on Indian payments |

### Indian ITR -- July 31

The big Indian deadline. Your income tax return for AY 2026-27 (covering FY 2025-26) is due July 31.

**Which form?** Most NRIs use **ITR-2** (income from salary, house property, capital gains, other sources, no business income). NRIs generally cannot use ITR-1. If you have business income, use ITR-3 (extended deadline in August).

**What to report**: Rental income, NRO interest (NRE interest is exempt), capital gains from Indian property/MFs/stocks, dividends from Indian companies, and any other income accruing in India.

**Penalty**: Up to Rs 5,000 under Section 234F. Below Rs 5 lakh total income, the fee caps at Rs 1,000.

### Form 67 -- July 31

If you are claiming a Foreign Tax Credit in India (i.e., you want credit for taxes paid to the US on income that India also taxes), you must file Form 67 **on or before** the due date of your ITR. This is a separate filing from the ITR itself, and many NRIs miss it entirely, resulting in denial of the foreign tax credit.

### TDS Return Q1 India -- July 31

TDS return for April through June 2026.

---

## August 2026

| Deadline | Filing | Authority | Who Needs This |
|----------|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Aug 31 | Indian ITR-3 / ITR-4 (AY 2026-27) | India IT Dept | NRIs with business/professional income in India |

### ITR-3 and ITR-4 -- August 31

If you have business or professional income in India requiring a tax audit, your ITR deadline extends to August 31. This affects NRIs who run businesses in India, have consultancy income from Indian clients, or have professional practices registered there.

---

## September 2026

| Deadline | Filing | Authority | Who Needs This |
|----------|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Sep 15 | Q3 Estimated Tax (2026) | IRS | NRIs with US income not subject to withholding |
| Sep 15 | Advance Tax Q2 (FY 2026-27) | India IT Dept | NRIs with Indian tax liability over Rs 10,000 |

### Q3 Estimated Tax -- September 15

Third quarterly estimated tax payment to the IRS for 2026.

### Advance Tax Q2 India -- September 15

Second installment of advance tax for FY 2026-27. By this date, you should have paid at least 45% of your estimated Indian tax liability (cumulative with the June installment).

---

## October 2026

| Deadline | Filing | Authority | Who Needs This |
|----------|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Oct 15 | Extended Form 1040 | IRS | NRIs who filed Form 4868 |
| Oct 15 | Extended FBAR (FinCEN 114) | FinCEN | NRIs who did not file FBAR by Apr 15 |
| Oct 15 | Extended FATCA Form 8938 | IRS | NRIs who filed tax extension |
| Oct 15 | Extended PFIC Form 8621 | IRS | NRIs who filed tax extension |
| Oct 31 | TDS Return Q2 (Jul-Sep 2026) | India IT Dept | NRIs who deduct TDS on Indian payments |

### Extended Form 1040 -- October 15

If you filed Form 4868 in April, this is your hard deadline. No further extensions. If you owed tax and did not pay by April 15, you have been accruing failure-to-pay penalties (0.5%/month) and interest since then.

### Extended FBAR -- October 15

The automatic FBAR extension expires. If you have not filed for 2025, this is it. After October 15, you are delinquent. $10,000 per account per year.

### Extended FATCA and PFIC -- October 15

Form 8938 and Form 8621 follow the extended 1040 deadline.

### TDS Return Q2 India -- October 31

TDS return for July through September 2026.

---

## December 2026

| Deadline | Filing | Authority | Who Needs This |
|----------|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Dec 15 | Advance Tax Q3 (FY 2026-27) | India IT Dept | NRIs with Indian tax liability over Rs 10,000 |
| Dec 31 | Belated ITR (AY 2026-27) | India IT Dept | NRIs who missed the Jul 31 deadline |
| Dec 31 | Bank KYC Update | Indian Banks / RBI | NRIs with Indian bank accounts |

### Advance Tax Q3 India -- December 15

Third installment of advance tax for FY 2026-27. By this date, you should have paid at least 75% of your estimated Indian tax liability.

### Belated ITR -- December 31

Missed July 31? You can still file a belated return under Section 139(4) until December 31, 2026. But you will pay up to Rs 5,000 in late fees, you cannot carry forward capital or business losses, you lose the option to revise, and Section 234A interest applies from the original due date. File as soon as possible.

### Bank KYC Update -- December 31

Indian banks require periodic KYC updates, especially for NRI accounts. Failure to update can result in your account being frozen. HDFC, SBI, ICICI, and others have their own timelines, but December 31 is a common annual cut-off. Read more about [your full set of NRI tax obligations](/blog/nri-tax-obligations).

## The Quarterly Cadence at a Glance

If you want a simplified view of just the quarterly obligations that repeat, here it is:

| Quarter | US Estimated Tax | India Advance Tax | India TDS Return |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Q1 | Apr 15 | Jun 15 (15% cumulative) | Jul 31 |
| Q2 | Jun 15 | Sep 15 (45% cumulative) | Oct 31 |
| Q3 | Sep 15 | Dec 15 (75% cumulative) | Jan 31 |
| Q4 | Jan 15 (next year) | Mar 15 (100% cumulative) | May 31 |

Notice that US estimated tax quarters and Indian advance tax quarters do not align. The US runs Apr-Jun-Sep-Jan. India runs Jun-Sep-Dec-Mar. You need to track both independently.

## How to Actually Stay on Top of This

Reading a list of deadlines is one thing. Remembering them six months from now is another.

1. **Identify which deadlines apply to you**. Not all 20+ deadlines on this page are relevant to your situation. [Check which deadlines apply to you](/quiz) -- 2 minutes, personalized results.

2. **Set reminders at 30, 15, and 7 days out**. A reminder on the due date is useless. You need lead time to gather documents and coordinate with your CA or CPA.

3. **Front-load April**. Start preparing your 1040, FBAR, FATCA, and PFIC forms in February. If you have Indian mutual funds, each PFIC form takes time to prepare.

4. **Keep Indian documents accessible year-round**. Form 26AS, AIS, TDS certificates, bank statements, capital gains statements -- download them when available, not the week before filing.

5. **Use the [interactive compliance calendar](/calendar)**. It shows only the deadlines relevant to your profile and sends reminders automatically.

## Key Takeaways

- NRIs in the US face **20+ compliance deadlines** across two countries every year.
- **April is the most dangerous month**, with Form 1040, FBAR, FATCA, PFIC, estimated tax, and extension requests all due on April 15.
- **FBAR penalties are the most severe**: $10,000 per account per year for non-willful violations, $100,000+ for willful violations. Do not skip this filing.
- **PAN-Aadhaar linking by June 30** prevents your PAN from becoming inoperative, which would trigger 20% TDS on all Indian payments to you.
- **Indian ITR is due July 31** for most NRIs. Miss it and you pay up to Rs 5,000 in late fees, lose the ability to carry forward losses, and accrue interest.
- **US and Indian quarterly obligations do not align** -- you need to track estimated tax and advance tax on separate schedules.
- **Not every deadline applies to every NRI**. Your specific obligations depend on your assets, income sources, and filing status. [Take the 2-minute quiz](/quiz) to get a personalized list.

This calendar is your reference for 2026. Bookmark it, share it with your spouse, and forward it to any NRI friends who are still guessing about what they owe. Because the penalties for guessing wrong are not worth it.

Don't guess. Know.
