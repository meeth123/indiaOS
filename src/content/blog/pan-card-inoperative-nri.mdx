## What Happened to 100 Million+ PAN Cards

If you have not checked on your Indian PAN card recently, there is a real chance it has been quietly deactivated. Not suspended. Not flagged. _Inoperative_. As in: it does not work anymore.

Here is the backstory. In 2017, the Indian government made it mandatory to link your PAN (Permanent Account Number) with your Aadhaar number. The idea was simple -- one person, one PAN, one Aadhaar, no duplicates, no tax evasion.

The original deadline was set for March 2022. Then it was pushed to June 2022. Then March 2023. Then June 2023. Each time, lakhs of people waited it out.

On **July 1, 2023**, the Income Tax Department stopped waiting. Every PAN card that had not been linked with Aadhaar was marked **inoperative** under Section 139AA of the Income Tax Act. The CBDT had warned this was coming through Circular No. 3/2023 in March of that year.

The numbers are staggering. Out of approximately 700 million PAN cards issued, over **110 million were made inoperative** in a single sweep. That is roughly 1 in 6 PAN cards in India.

And here is the part that matters to you: a disproportionate number of those belong to NRIs.

Why? Because most NRIs left India before the Aadhaar enrollment wave hit full stride. Many never enrolled. Others enrolled but never completed biometric updates. And the linking process itself required an Indian mobile number and access to the Aadhaar portal -- neither of which is easy to manage from Houston or San Jose.

The result: millions of NRIs are walking around with an inoperative PAN and have no idea. Their banks know. The IT Department knows. They do not.

## Are NRIs Exempt from PAN-Aadhaar Linking?

This is where it gets nuanced, and where a lot of bad information floats around online.

The short answer: **it depends on whether you have an Aadhaar number.**

### If You Do NOT Have Aadhaar

You are **exempt** from the PAN-Aadhaar linking requirement. The Income Tax Act Section 139AA(2) applies the mandate only to persons who are _eligible_ for Aadhaar. Since Aadhaar enrollment is tied to Indian residency (you need to have lived in India for 182+ days in the 12 months preceding the enrollment date), NRIs who never enrolled are technically outside the scope.

The CBDT has acknowledged this exemption through various circulars. Your PAN should remain operative if you were never issued an Aadhaar number.

**But** -- and this is a significant but -- the IT Department's automated systems do not always know you are an NRI. If your PAN records still show an Indian address, or if your residential status was never updated in the IT Department's database, the system may have flagged your PAN as inoperative anyway.

### If You DO Have Aadhaar

This is the more common situation for NRIs who lived in India through the 2010s. You enrolled for Aadhaar when you were a resident, then moved abroad. You have an Aadhaar number. It may be linked to an old Indian phone number you no longer use.

In this case, **you are NOT exempt**. You must link your PAN with Aadhaar, just like any resident Indian. The exemption is based on Aadhaar _enrollment status_, not on your current residency status. If an Aadhaar number was ever issued to you, the linking mandate applies.

### The Gray Area

Many NRIs fall somewhere in between:

- **Started Aadhaar enrollment but never completed it** -- your enrollment may or may not have resulted in an Aadhaar number being issued
- **Aadhaar is inactive or suspended** due to non-use -- the number still exists, so technically the mandate still applies
- **Changed citizenship** -- if you renounced Indian citizenship and hold OCI, you may still have a valid Aadhaar (India does not automatically cancel it)
- **Have Aadhaar but biometrics are outdated** -- the linking process may fail because your Aadhaar details are stale

The common thread: the system defaults to "inoperative" when in doubt. The burden of proving exemption or completing the link falls entirely on you.

## Consequences of an Inoperative PAN

This is not just a bureaucratic inconvenience. An inoperative PAN has real, measurable financial consequences that hit NRIs especially hard.

### 1. 20% TDS Instead of 10% (or Less)

This is the big one. When your PAN is inoperative, banks and financial institutions are required to deduct TDS at **20%** instead of the normal rate. Under Section 206AA, if a valid PAN is not furnished, the higher rate kicks in automatically.

For NRIs with Indian fixed deposits, this is punishing. Normally, TDS on FD interest for NRIs is deducted at 30% (or the DTAA rate, which is typically 10-15% for US residents). But the actual rate applied depends on submitting proper documentation including a valid PAN.

With an inoperative PAN, the bank treats it as if you have no PAN at all. The TDS rate on your FD interest could jump to **30% or higher**, and you lose the ability to claim DTAA benefits. On a Rs 20 lakh FD earning 7.5% interest, that is an extra Rs 15,000-30,000 in excess TDS per year.

### 2. Cannot File Your Indian Income Tax Return

An inoperative PAN cannot be used to file an ITR. The e-filing portal will simply reject your attempt. This means:

- You cannot report your Indian income
- You cannot claim refunds on excess TDS deducted
- You cannot carry forward losses
- You cannot close out your Indian tax obligations cleanly

For NRIs who need to file an Indian ITR (because they have Indian-sourced income above the basic exemption limit), this creates a cascading compliance failure. You owe a return but literally cannot file it.

### 3. Cannot Receive Tax Refunds

Even if you were owed a refund from a previously filed return, the IT Department will not process it if your PAN is inoperative. The refund sits in limbo until you fix your PAN status.

### 4. Blocked from High-Value Transactions

Under Rule 114B of the Income Tax Rules, PAN is mandatory for a range of financial transactions. With an inoperative PAN, you cannot:

- Open a new bank account or demat account in India
- Buy or sell property above Rs 10 lakh
- Purchase mutual funds above Rs 50,000
- Make time deposits above Rs 50,000
- Buy or sell shares through a broker
- Pay cash exceeding Rs 50,000 to hotels or restaurants (relevant when you visit)
- Make foreign currency transactions above Rs 50,000

For NRIs managing Indian assets remotely, this can freeze your ability to make any meaningful financial move.

### 5. Mutual Funds and Stock Investments Affected

If you hold Indian mutual funds or stocks, your KYC is tied to your PAN. An inoperative PAN can trigger KYC failures, which means:

- SIPs may be automatically stopped
- Redemption requests may be blocked or delayed
- Dividend payments may be subject to higher TDS
- New investments will be rejected

## How to Check Your PAN Status

Before you panic, check. It takes two minutes.

### Method 1: Income Tax e-Filing Portal

1. Go to [incometax.gov.in](https://www.incometax.gov.in)
2. On the homepage, look for **"Verify Your PAN"** or navigate to **Quick Links > Know Your PAN**
3. Enter your PAN number, full name as on PAN, date of birth, and mobile number
4. You will receive an OTP on your registered mobile
5. After verification, the portal will show your PAN status as either **Active** or **Inoperative**

**Problem for NRIs**: The OTP goes to your Indian mobile number registered with the IT Department. If you no longer have that number, this method may not work. In that case, try Method 2.

### Method 2: NSDL PAN Status Check

1. Go to the [NSDL PAN portal](https://www.onlineservices.nsdl.com/paam/endUserRegisterContact.html)
2. Select **"PAN status enquiry"**
3. Enter your PAN, name, and date of birth
4. The system will confirm whether your PAN is Active or Inoperative

### Method 3: Send an SMS

You can SMS **NSDLPAN** followed by your 10-digit PAN number to **57575** from an Indian mobile number. The response will include your PAN status.

### Method 4: Check with Your Indian Bank

Call your NRE/NRO bank's customer service. Ask them to confirm the PAN status on file. If your PAN is inoperative, they will already know -- it affects their TDS calculations on your account.

## How to Reactivate Your PAN

If your PAN is inoperative and you have an Aadhaar number, here is the fix.

### Step 1: Pay the Late Linking Fee

The fee for linking PAN with Aadhaar after the deadline is **Rs 1,000**. This is non-negotiable and non-refundable, regardless of whether you are an NRI or resident.

Pay through the [NSDL e-Pay Tax portal](https://onlineservices.nsdl.com/paam/endUserRegisterContact.html):

1. Go to the portal and select **"Challan No. / ITNS 280"**
2. Under Tax Applicable, select **"Other than Companies"**
3. Under Type of Payment, select **"Fee (0021)"** with Minor Head **500**
4. Enter your PAN, assessment year, and address
5. Pay Rs 1,000 via net banking or debit card
6. Save the challan receipt -- you will need it

### Step 2: Link PAN with Aadhaar

After paying the fee:

1. Go to [incometax.gov.in](https://www.incometax.gov.in)
2. Navigate to **Quick Links > Link Aadhaar**
3. Enter your PAN number and Aadhaar number
4. Verify the details and submit
5. An OTP will be sent to the mobile number registered with Aadhaar

**Critical NRI issue**: The OTP goes to your Aadhaar-registered mobile number. If that is an Indian number you no longer have, you will need to update your Aadhaar mobile number first. This usually requires visiting an Aadhaar enrollment center in India, or using the mAadhaar app if you still have the old number active for initial verification.

### Step 3: Wait for Reactivation

After successful linking, your PAN will be reactivated within **30 days**. The CBDT has stated this timeline in its official notifications. In practice, many people report it happening within 7-15 days.

You will not receive a notification when it is done. You need to check your PAN status again using the methods above to confirm reactivation.

### Step 4: Notify Your Banks and Financial Institutions

Once your PAN is active again, inform your Indian banks, mutual fund houses, and demat account providers. They need to update their records so that:

- TDS rates revert to normal
- KYC is restored
- Transaction blocks are lifted

Do not assume this happens automatically. Each institution maintains its own PAN status records, and they update on different schedules.

## What If You Do Not Have Aadhaar?

If you are an NRI who never enrolled for Aadhaar, your situation is different -- and in some ways simpler, in other ways more complicated.

### Claiming the NRI Exemption

The good news: you are exempt from the linking mandate. The challenge: you may need to proactively inform the IT Department of your exempt status, especially if your PAN has already been marked inoperative by mistake.

Here is what to do:

### Step 1: Update Your Residential Status with the IT Department

File a **Form 60** or contact the jurisdictional Assessing Officer (AO) to update your residential status to NRI. This can be done through:

- The e-filing portal at incometax.gov.in (if you can log in)
- A written letter to your jurisdictional AO with supporting documentation
- Through a Chartered Accountant who can file on your behalf

### Step 2: Provide Supporting Documentation

You will typically need:

- Copy of your passport showing departure stamps or visa status
- Copy of your US visa or Green Card
- Proof of US tax residency (e.g., IRS transcript or US tax return cover page)
- A declaration stating you are not enrolled for Aadhaar
- Copy of your PAN card

### Step 3: Follow Up

The IT Department does not have an expedited process for this. You may need to follow up multiple times. Keep records of all communications, challan receipts, and application references.

### Alternative: Get an Aadhaar

Some NRIs find it simpler to just enroll for Aadhaar on their next trip to India and link it with PAN. Aadhaar enrollment for NRIs is possible at designated enrollment centers. You need your Indian passport (or OCI card) and a valid Indian address proof.

This approach sidesteps the exemption paperwork entirely, but it does require a physical visit to India and the Rs 1,000 late linking fee.

## Impact on Your Indian Investments

An inoperative PAN does not just create tax hassles. It has a ripple effect across every Indian financial instrument you hold.

### Fixed Deposits

Your bank will deduct TDS at the higher rate (20% or more) on all FD interest. If you have multiple FDs across banks, each bank applies the higher rate independently. The excess TDS can only be recovered by filing an ITR -- which you cannot do with an inoperative PAN. You are stuck in a circular trap.

If you hold FDs earning Rs 3-5 lakh in annual interest (common for NRIs who parked money in India before moving), the excess TDS could be Rs 30,000-50,000 per year. Over two or three years of an inoperative PAN, that adds up fast.

### Mutual Funds

AMCs (Asset Management Companies) rely on PAN-based KYC. An inoperative PAN can result in:

- **Automatic SIP stoppages** -- some AMCs freeze SIPs tied to inoperative PANs
- **Redemption holds** -- your redemption may be processed but payment delayed until PAN is revalidated
- **Lump sum investment rejection** -- new investments above Rs 50,000 will be blocked
- **Higher TDS on capital gains** -- when you sell, the AMC deducts TDS at the higher rate

If you have Indian mutual fund investments, check with your AMC directly. Some (like HDFC AMC and ICICI Prudential) have sent communication to affected investors, but many NRIs miss these emails because they go to old Indian email addresses.

### Stock Trading and Demat Accounts

Your demat account (CDSL or NSDL) is linked to your PAN. An inoperative PAN means:

- You cannot sell existing holdings (or you can, but at punitive TDS rates)
- You cannot buy new shares
- Dividend income is subject to higher TDS
- Broker KYC compliance fails, potentially freezing your account

If you have an active Indian stock portfolio through Zerodha, Groww, or any other broker, this is urgent. Contact your broker to understand your account status.

### Property Transactions

Buying or selling property in India requires PAN for transactions above Rs 10 lakh. With an inoperative PAN:

- You cannot register a property sale or purchase
- The buyer (if you are selling) cannot deduct TDS properly
- The registrar may refuse to process the transaction

If you are planning to sell Indian property, fix your PAN status _before_ you list it. The last thing you want is a deal falling through because of a PAN issue that takes 30 days to resolve.

### NPS and EPF

If you contributed to the National Pension System (NPS) or have an old Employee Provident Fund (EPF) balance, withdrawals require a valid PAN. An inoperative PAN can delay or block these withdrawals. Given that many NRIs have EPF balances from their pre-move employment, this is a common pain point.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Over 110 million PAN cards were made inoperative** on July 1, 2023 for not linking with Aadhaar. NRIs were disproportionately affected.

2. **NRIs without Aadhaar are exempt** from the linking requirement -- but you may need to proactively prove your exempt status to the IT Department.

3. **NRIs with Aadhaar are NOT exempt.** You must link and pay the Rs 1,000 late fee.

4. **An inoperative PAN means 20%+ TDS** on FD interest, blocked ITR filing, frozen transactions, and KYC failures across banks, mutual funds, and demat accounts.

5. **Check your PAN status today** at [incometax.gov.in](https://www.incometax.gov.in). It takes two minutes.

6. **Reactivation takes about 30 days** after linking. The sooner you start, the sooner you stop bleeding excess TDS.

7. **Notify all your Indian financial institutions** after reactivation. Do not assume they update automatically.

8. **PAN is just one of 19 compliance obligations** that apply to most NRIs. If your PAN slipped through the cracks, there is a good chance other items have too. [Take the compliance quiz](/quiz) to find out what else you might be missing.
