You moved to the US. You still have mutual funds in India — maybe SIPs you started years ago, maybe a lump sum parked in a debt fund. You file your US taxes every year. You think you are covered.

You are almost certainly not.

Those Indian mutual funds are classified by the IRS as **Passive Foreign Investment Companies (PFICs)** — and PFICs come with some of the most punitive tax treatment in the entire US tax code. We are talking tax rates that can exceed your actual gains, interest charges that compound year over year, and a statute of limitations that **never starts** if you do not file.

This is not a hypothetical risk. This is the single most common compliance gap we see among NRIs in the US. And most people have no idea it exists.

## What Is a PFIC?

A Passive Foreign Investment Company (PFIC) is an IRS classification for any foreign corporation that meets **either** of two tests:

- **Income Test**: 75% or more of the corporation's gross income is passive income (interest, dividends, rents, royalties, capital gains from securities)
- **Asset Test**: 50% or more of the corporation's assets produce or are held to produce passive income

That is it. If a foreign entity passes either test, it is a PFIC in the eyes of the IRS.

### Why Indian Mutual Funds Are Almost Always PFICs

Indian mutual funds — whether equity, debt, hybrid, ELSS, or liquid — are structured as trusts in India but are treated as **foreign corporations** by the IRS for tax classification purposes. And here is the problem:

- An **equity mutual fund** holds stocks. Stocks are passive assets. The fund earns dividends and capital gains. That is passive income. It passes both tests.
- A **debt mutual fund** holds bonds and fixed-income instruments. Interest income is passive. It passes both tests easily.
- A **hybrid fund** is a mix. It still passes at least one test.
- An **ELSS (tax saver) fund** is an equity fund with a 3-year lock-in. Still a PFIC.
- A **liquid fund** or **money market fund** — absolutely a PFIC.

**Every single category of Indian mutual fund qualifies as a PFIC.** There are no exceptions. If the fund is domiciled in India and you are a US person (citizen, green card holder, or resident alien), it is a PFIC.

This also applies to:
- UTI funds
- SBI Mutual Fund
- HDFC Mutual Fund
- ICICI Prudential
- Axis, Kotak, DSP, Mirae — all of them

The legal structure does not matter. The AMC does not matter. The fund category does not matter. If it is a non-US mutual fund, the IRS classifies it as a PFIC.

## Why This Matters for NRIs

The IRS did not create the PFIC rules to target NRIs. These rules exist to prevent US taxpayers from deferring income through offshore investment vehicles. But the practical impact hits NRIs harder than almost anyone else, because millions of NRIs hold Indian mutual funds they started long before moving to the US.

Here is what makes PFIC treatment so punitive:

### 1. No Long-Term Capital Gains Rate

When you sell US-domiciled index funds or ETFs at a profit, you pay the long-term capital gains rate — currently 0%, 15%, or 20% depending on your income. That is the preferential rate most investors plan around.

PFICs do not get this rate. Under the default PFIC regime, your gains are taxed at **ordinary income rates** — which can be as high as **37%** at the federal level. The long-term capital gains benefit does not exist for PFICs.

### 2. Excess Distribution Regime

The default PFIC tax method (Section 1291) uses something called the "excess distribution" regime. Here is how it works:

1. When you sell a PFIC or receive a distribution that exceeds 125% of the average distributions over the prior three years, the IRS calls that an "excess distribution."
2. The excess distribution is **allocated ratably** across every year you held the PFIC.
3. The portion allocated to each prior year is taxed at the **highest marginal rate** that was in effect for that year — not your actual bracket, the highest one.
4. On top of that, the IRS charges **interest** on the tax for each prior year, as if the tax was due and unpaid in that year.

This compounding interest charge is the real killer. If you held an Indian mutual fund for 10 years, the interest charges alone can push your effective tax rate well above 50% of your gains. In some cases, the total tax plus interest can **exceed 100% of your actual profit**.

### 3. Distributions Are Not Qualified Dividends

Even if your Indian mutual fund pays distributions (dividends or capital gains distributions), these are not treated as qualified dividends. They are taxed as ordinary income — no preferential rates.

### 4. No Step-Up in Basis at Death

For most US investments, when a taxpayer dies, the heirs receive a "step-up" in cost basis to the fair market value at the date of death. This effectively wipes out unrealized capital gains. PFICs do not get this treatment. The PFIC taint carries through to heirs.

> If you hold Indian mutual funds as a US person and have not been reporting them as PFICs, you are accumulating tax liability that compounds every year you delay. This is not the kind of problem that gets better with time.

## The Three PFIC Reporting Methods

The IRS gives you three options for how PFICs are taxed. Two require an active election. The third is the default — and it is the worst.

### Method 1: QEF Election (Qualified Electing Fund)

The QEF election is theoretically the best option. You include your share of the fund's ordinary earnings and net capital gains in your income each year, whether or not the fund distributes them. This avoids the excess distribution regime entirely, and capital gains get taxed at the favorable long-term rate.

**The catch**: To make a QEF election, the fund must provide a **PFIC Annual Information Statement** — a document that breaks down the fund's ordinary earnings and net capital gains on a per-share basis.

**No Indian mutual fund provides this.** Indian AMCs have never heard of a PFIC Annual Information Statement. They are not required to produce one under Indian regulations, and they have no infrastructure to do so.

This means the QEF election is **practically unavailable** for Indian mutual funds. Do not count on it.

### Method 2: Mark-to-Market Election (Section 1296)

This is the best realistic option for most NRIs holding Indian mutual funds. Here is how it works:

- At the end of each tax year, you "mark" your PFIC holdings to their current fair market value.
- If the value went up, you include the unrealized gain as **ordinary income** on your tax return for that year.
- If the value went down, you can deduct the unrealized loss (but only to the extent of prior mark-to-market gains — you cannot create a net loss from PFIC mark-to-market).
- When you eventually sell, you have already been paying tax on the gains annually, so there is no excess distribution problem.

**Requirements for Mark-to-Market**:
- The PFIC shares must be "marketable stock" — meaning regularly traded on a qualified exchange. Indian mutual funds traded on recognized Indian exchanges (BSE, NSE) or with daily NAV reporting generally qualify.
- You must make the election on **Form 8621** and file it with your tax return.
- The election must be made in the first year the mark-to-market treatment is to apply.

**Advantages**:
- Avoids the punitive excess distribution regime
- Annual tax impact is predictable
- No need for a PFIC Annual Information Statement from the fund

**Disadvantages**:
- Gains are taxed as ordinary income, not capital gains
- You pay tax on unrealized gains every year (cash flow impact if the fund did not actually distribute)
- Losses are limited

For most NRIs, the mark-to-market election is the clear choice. It is not perfect — you still lose the capital gains rate — but it is far better than the default.

### Method 3: Section 1291 Default (No Election)

If you do not make either a QEF or mark-to-market election, you land in the **Section 1291 default** regime. This is the excess distribution method described above: your gains get allocated across all holding years, taxed at the highest rate for each year, and hit with compounding interest.

This is where most NRIs end up — not by choice, but because they did not know about PFIC at all and filed nothing.

**This is the worst possible outcome, and it is the default.**

| Method | Tax Rate | Interest Charges | Requires Fund Cooperation | Practical for Indian MFs |
|--------|----------|-----------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| QEF Election | Ordinary income + capital gains | None | Yes (Annual Information Statement) | No — Indian funds do not provide it |
| Mark-to-Market | Ordinary income | None | No (just need market value) | Yes — best realistic option |
| Section 1291 Default | Highest marginal rate per year | Yes — compounding | No | Yes — but this is the punitive default |

## How to File Form 8621

Form 8621 is titled "Information Return by a Shareholder of a Passive Foreign Investment Company or Qualified Electing Fund." You must file a **separate Form 8621 for each PFIC you own** — meaning each individual mutual fund scheme is its own Form 8621.

If you hold 5 Indian mutual fund schemes, you file 5 copies of Form 8621. If you hold 12, you file 12.

### What Information You Need

For each PFIC (each mutual fund scheme):

- **Fund name and address**: The AMC name, registered address in India
- **EIN or reference ID**: Indian mutual funds do not have a US EIN. You use a reference ID number that you assign (the IRS allows this for foreign entities without an EIN)
- **Share class and number of units**: How many units you hold at year-end
- **Date of acquisition**: When you first purchased units in the fund
- **Fair market value at beginning and end of year**: NAV per unit multiplied by your units. You can get NAV data from the AMC website, AMFI India (amfiindia.com), or your fund statement
- **Distributions received**: Any dividends, capital gains distributions, or redemption proceeds during the year
- **Election type**: Mark-to-market, QEF, or Section 1291 default

### Where to Get NAV Data

For the mark-to-market election, you need the NAV on the last day of the tax year (December 31 for calendar-year filers) and the NAV on January 1 (or your acquisition date if purchased during the year).

Sources for historical NAV:
- **AMFI India** (amfiindia.com) — official NAV data for all Indian mutual funds
- **Your AMC's website** — fund-specific NAV lookup
- **Your consolidated account statement (CAS)** from CAMS or KFintech
- **Value Research Online** or **Moneycontrol** — third-party NAV trackers

You will also need to convert INR to USD. Use the IRS-accepted exchange rate for December 31 of the tax year. The Treasury Department publishes yearly average rates, or you can use the spot rate on the relevant date from a reputable source.

### Filing With Your Tax Return

Form 8621 is filed as an attachment to your **Form 1040** (or 1040-NR). It is an information return, but it also calculates any tax due under the PFIC regime.

If you are making a mark-to-market election, you will:
1. Complete Part I (shareholder information)
2. Complete Part II (elections — check the mark-to-market box)
3. Complete Part IV (gain or loss from mark-to-market)
4. Report the gain or loss as ordinary income on your Form 1040

If you are stuck in the Section 1291 default, the calculations in Part V and Part VI of Form 8621 are significantly more complex and typically require professional help.

### When Form 8621 Is Required

You must file Form 8621 for each PFIC in any year where:
- You receive a direct or indirect distribution from the PFIC
- You recognize gain on the disposition (sale) of PFIC shares
- You are making an election (mark-to-market or QEF)
- You are required to report certain annual information under Section 1298(f)

The Section 1298(f) reporting requirement means that in most cases, **you must file Form 8621 every year you hold any PFIC shares**, even if you had no distributions and did not sell anything. This was expanded by IRS regulations and applies broadly.

## The Real Cost of Ignoring PFIC

This is where things get genuinely alarming. Most NRIs we talk to have never heard of PFIC. They have been holding Indian mutual funds for years — sometimes a decade or more — without filing a single Form 8621.

Here is what that means:

### The Statute of Limitations Never Starts

Normally, the IRS has 3 years from the date you file a return to audit it (6 years if you underreport income by more than 25%). But for Form 8621, the statute of limitations on the **entire tax return** does not begin until the form is filed.

Read that again. If you were required to file Form 8621 for 2018 and did not, the IRS can audit your entire 2018 tax return — not just the PFIC portion — at any point in the future. There is no time limit. The clock never started.

This applies to every year you held PFICs and did not file Form 8621. If you have been holding Indian mutual funds for 8 years without filing, you have 8 years of tax returns with no statute of limitations protection.

### Punitive Tax Can Exceed 100% of Gains

Under the Section 1291 default, the combination of highest-marginal-rate taxation plus compounding interest charges can result in a total tax bill that exceeds the actual gain on the investment. This is not theoretical — it is a mathematical consequence of holding PFICs for many years without an election.

Consider this simplified example:
- You invested Rs 10,00,000 in an Indian equity mutual fund in 2016
- The fund doubled in value by 2026 — your gain is Rs 10,00,000
- Under Section 1291, this gain is allocated across 10 years
- Each year's allocation is taxed at the highest rate (37%) plus interest from that year
- The interest alone on the early years (2016, 2017, 2018) compounds significantly

The result: your total tax plus interest can approach or exceed the Rs 10,00,000 gain itself. You could owe more in tax than you earned.

### Penalties Stack

On top of the punitive PFIC tax treatment:
- **Failure to file Form 8621**: While there is no specific standalone penalty for Form 8621 itself, the open statute of limitations is itself a massive risk
- **FBAR penalties**: If your Indian mutual funds, combined with other Indian financial accounts, exceed $10,000 in aggregate at any point during the year, you also owe an [FBAR](/blog/fbar-guide-2026). Willful failure to file an FBAR carries penalties up to $100,000 or 50% of the account balance per violation per year
- **FATCA / Form 8938 penalties**: If your foreign financial assets exceed the Form 8938 thresholds ($50,000-$200,000 depending on filing status and residency), you owe a FATCA report too. Penalty: $10,000 per failure, up to $60,000 for continued non-filing
- **Accuracy-related penalties**: 20% penalty on any underpayment of tax related to PFICs

These obligations overlap but are separate. You can be penalized under each one independently.

> The IRS does not see "I didn't know" as a defense. PFIC rules have been on the books since 1986. Ignorance reduces your options for relief, it does not eliminate your liability.

## What Should NRIs Do With Indian Mutual Funds?

If you are reading this and realizing you have a PFIC problem, here are your options — ranked from simplest to most complex.

### Option 1: Sell Before Becoming a US Person

If you have not yet moved to the US or have not yet become a US tax resident, sell your Indian mutual funds before your residency start date. Gains realized while you are not a US person are generally not subject to US tax (though they may be subject to Indian capital gains tax).

This is the cleanest solution, but it only works if you have not yet crossed the line into US tax residency.

### Option 2: Hold and Report Properly Going Forward

If you are already a US person and want to keep your Indian mutual funds:
1. Make a **mark-to-market election** on Form 8621 for each fund
2. File Form 8621 annually with your Form 1040
3. Report the year-end mark-to-market gain or loss as ordinary income
4. Also file your [FBAR](/blog/fbar-guide-2026) and [FATCA Form 8938](/blog/nri-tax-obligations) if thresholds are met

The first year you make the mark-to-market election, you will recognize any built-up gain as a "Section 1291 fund" (since you did not have the election in prior years). This means the initial mark-to-market gain gets the punitive Section 1291 treatment. After that first year, you are in the clean mark-to-market regime going forward.

This is called a **"Section 1296 purge"** — and it can be painful, but it stops the bleeding.

### Option 3: Sell and Reinvest in US-Domiciled Funds

For many NRIs, the simplest long-term solution is:
1. Sell your Indian mutual funds
2. Deal with the PFIC tax on the disposition (ideally with professional help)
3. Reinvest the proceeds in **US-domiciled mutual funds or ETFs** that provide similar exposure

Want exposure to Indian equities? Buy a US-listed India ETF like iShares MSCI India ETF (INDA) or WisdomTree India Earnings Fund (EPI). These are US-domiciled, issue 1099s, qualify for long-term capital gains rates, and have zero PFIC issues.

This is the nuclear option — it means liquidating your Indian investments — but it permanently eliminates the PFIC compliance burden.

### Option 4: File Delinquent Returns (If You Are Behind)

If you have been holding Indian mutual funds for years without filing Form 8621, you have a compliance gap. You have several paths to come clean:

- **Streamlined Filing Compliance Procedures**: If you can certify that your failure to file was non-willful, you can use the IRS Streamlined Procedures to file delinquent returns. For US residents, there is a 5% penalty on foreign financial assets. For non-residents, the penalty is waived entirely.
- **Voluntary Disclosure**: If your non-compliance was willful (or you cannot certify it was not), you may need to use the IRS Voluntary Disclosure process, which involves higher penalties but avoids criminal exposure.
- **Quiet disclosure** (filing amended returns without going through an official program): This is risky and generally not recommended, as the IRS views it unfavorably.

In all cases, **get professional help**. PFIC remediation is genuinely complex and the stakes are high. A cross-border tax professional (CPA or tax attorney with PFIC experience) is not optional here — it is essential.

## PFIC vs Regular Capital Gains: A Side-by-Side Comparison

This table shows the difference between selling a US-domiciled index fund and selling an Indian mutual fund (PFIC) for the same $10,000 gain, held for 5 years.

| Factor | US Index Fund | Indian Mutual Fund (PFIC — Section 1291) | Indian Mutual Fund (PFIC — Mark-to-Market) |
|--------|--------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Tax Rate on Gain | 15% LTCG (most brackets) | Up to 37% (highest marginal rate per year) | Ordinary income rate (up to 37%) |
| Interest Charges | None | Yes — compounding from each allocation year | None |
| Approximate Tax on $10,000 Gain | $1,500 | $4,500 - $6,000+ (varies by holding period) | $2,200 - $3,700 (depends on bracket) |
| Filing Requirement | 1099-B, Schedule D | Form 8621 per fund | Form 8621 per fund |
| Statute of Limitations | Normal (3 years) | Does not start until Form 8621 filed | Normal (if Form 8621 filed) |
| Loss Deduction | Up to $3,000/year + carryforward | Limited under Section 1291 | Limited to prior MTM gains |
| Step-Up at Death | Yes | No | Partial |
| FBAR / FATCA Reporting | No | Yes (if thresholds met) | Yes (if thresholds met) |

The difference is stark. For the same investment return, the PFIC holder pays 2x to 4x more in tax — and carries significantly more compliance risk.

## Common Questions About PFIC and Indian Mutual Funds

### Do SIPs (Systematic Investment Plans) make PFIC tracking harder?

Yes. Each SIP installment is technically a separate acquisition with its own cost basis and holding period. If you have been running a monthly SIP for 5 years, you have 60 separate lots to track on Form 8621. This is one of the reasons professional help is strongly recommended for NRIs with active SIPs.

### What about Indian ETFs listed on NSE/BSE?

Same treatment. Indian ETFs (Nifty BeES, Bank BeES, Nippon India ETF, etc.) are PFICs just like mutual funds. The fund domicile is what matters, not the fund structure.

### Does the India-US DTAA (Double Tax Avoidance Agreement) help?

The DTAA helps avoid double taxation on some types of income, but it does not override the PFIC regime. You can claim a foreign tax credit for taxes paid to India on the same income, which reduces your US tax liability — but the PFIC excess distribution calculations and interest charges still apply under Section 1291.

### What if my Indian mutual fund investments are very small?

There is a **former Section 1298 exception** for PFICs with aggregate value under $25,000 ($50,000 for joint filers) that may exempt you from the annual filing requirement in years where you have no distributions and no dispositions. However, you are still subject to the PFIC regime when you eventually sell, and the statute of limitations issue remains. Do not assume small amounts mean no filing obligation — check with a tax professional.

### Are NPS (National Pension System) and EPF affected?

NPS and EPF are not mutual funds and have different (also complex) treatment. NPS is likely a foreign trust or potentially a PFIC depending on its investment structure. EPF is generally treated as a foreign trust under the grantor trust rules. Both have their own reporting requirements. See [full NRI tax obligations](/blog/nri-tax-obligations) for details.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Every Indian mutual fund is a PFIC.** Equity, debt, hybrid, ELSS, liquid — all of them. No exceptions.

2. **The default PFIC tax treatment is punitive.** Highest marginal rates, compounding interest charges, and effective tax rates that can exceed your actual gains.

3. **The mark-to-market election is your best realistic option.** QEF is unavailable for Indian funds. Mark-to-market is manageable and avoids the excess distribution nightmare.

4. **Form 8621 is required for each PFIC you hold.** Five mutual fund schemes means five forms. Every year.

5. **The statute of limitations never starts without Form 8621.** Every year you skip filing opens your entire tax return to IRS audit — indefinitely.

6. **Selling and moving to US-domiciled funds eliminates the problem permanently.** US-listed India ETFs give you the same market exposure without the PFIC burden.

7. **If you are behind on filing, the Streamlined Procedures are your best path forward.** Non-willful non-compliance qualifies for reduced or zero penalties.

8. **Get professional help.** PFIC is genuinely one of the most complex areas of US tax law. A cross-border CPA or tax attorney with PFIC experience is worth every dollar.

Do not sit on this. The longer you wait, the more interest compounds, the more years of open statute of limitations accumulate, and the more painful the eventual reckoning becomes.
